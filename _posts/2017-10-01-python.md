## Geo-Python for the people
One of the things I've been working on this fall is the latest version of the [Introduction to Quantitative Geology course](https://introqg.github.io/) we offer for undergraduate students in their final year.
The course is divided into two parts, with the first half focussing on learning to program using Python, where we meet together with the [Automating GIS Processes course](https://autogis.gitbuh.io/) taught by doctoral student [Henrikki Tenkanen](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/person/hentenka) (with contributions from another doctoral student, [Vuokko Heihinheimo](https://tuhat.helsinki.fi/portal/en/person/vuokkhei)).
Henrikki and I recognized a few years ago that we both needed to devote more of our time to teaching [Python](https://www.python.org/) in our respective courses and the idea emerged that we could meet together in the first part of our courses, then separate for the second half to focus on our topical applications.
Anyway, we're now calling the first part of the course [Geo-Python](https://geo-python.github.io/), and we've put the [entire course online on GitHub](https://github.com/Geo-Python), where you're welcome to clone it and modify as you see fit.
Below, I'll describe a few things we do in the course from the course design perspective, in case they might be of interest to other teachers.

## Course materials
### Open course materials on GitHub
From the start, we wanted to make sure all of our course materials were freely available online, and in a location that would be reliable and easy to find.
In 2016, [the first time we taught the Geo-Python part of the course](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information), we opted to keep the course materials on [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com).
GitHub is a natural choice for several reasons, most notably that it is a website used by millions to share and collaborate on software.
There is also a growing user base interested in [using GitHub for educational purposes](https://education.github.com/), so that also helps in having some ideas of *how* GitHub can be used for teaching (via the [GitHub Education Community](https://education.github.community/), for instance).
Thus, we made the choice to create GitHub organizations for the course a broadly accessible space where we could store course-related files, divided among different repositories for individual lessons or exercises.
An added benefit with GitHub organizations for educational use is that they include [free private repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/discounted-organization-accounts/) in addition to the public repositories that are normally available.
This is nice because we want to keep as much of the course public as possible, but it is nice to have a private place to share plans for changes in the course, feedback, or files from the students that we don't want available to the public.


The model we have settled on is that we have [one GitHub organization for the course general information and lessons](https://github.com/geo-python/), and a second organization created each year for the exercises and student repositories ([2017](https://github.com/geo-python-2017/), for example).
The files in the main course repository are separated into different repositories for each year, with all of the lesson files within that repository.
This is convenient because we're able to keep course files around from year to year, so past students can visit the website of their version of the course as it was taught.
For the exercises and student submissions, however, we need separate organizations for each year.
This is for two reasons: (1) It makes it easier to keep all student repositories for a given year in one place, and (2) it is easier to manage users for each year this way.
If we kept a single organization for the students year to year, we would have trouble keeping repositories straight and sifting through and already large number of repositories for grading, etc.
Thus, a permanent home for the course in one organization and a new organization each year for the student files.

### Using GitHub Pages for course content
In 2016 we kept all of the course materials on GitHub with the lessons written completely in Markdown and navigable using links between Markdown documents, but this was not ideal.
Markdown is easy to work with, and renders nicely directly on GitHub.com, so it was our first choice for how to prepare course materials already meant to be stored on GitHub.com.
The problem is that although we, as experienced GitHub users, found navigating between pages in GitHub intuitive, the students often found it confusing.
In particular, it was hard to go between different parts of the lesson quickly.
We decided to add some navigation links to the bottom of each Markdown document to be able to go forward, back, and home, but this had to be done by hand as was subject to human error.
We needed a better solution.


GitHub Pages allows users to host webpages on GitHub.com, and is an appealing option for creating webpages for course materials.
The flexibility offered by GitHub Pages is great, since we could possibly avoid using an interface to the lesson materials that was hard for the students and required manual creation of links for navigation.
At the same time, creating a website by hand could be quite time consuming, and force us to possibly lose out on rapid creation of course materials using Markdown.
Again, we needed a solution for this issue.

### Organizing documentation with Sphinx
Sphinx is a web tool designed for creating project documentation with an intuitive, clean interface.
Furthermore, a number of people have begun hosting Sphinx documents on GitHub Pages.
Combined, this option is very appealing as it 


rST issues.
